## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I'm still learning some of the better ways to layout the page based on the design, and on trying to use semantic markup. The hover effect on the image was particularly difficult and I had to check out a bunch of other solutions to see how people had solved it before I could get it right. But, I'm more confident I could do something similar in the future now.
